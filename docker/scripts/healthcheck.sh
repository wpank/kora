# Health check script for Kora nodes.
#
# Modes (set via HEALTHCHECK_MODE env var):
#   dkg   - DKG ceremony completed (share.key + output.json exist)
#   p2p   - P2P port is listening
#   ready - RPC responsive AND chain is making progress AND consensus
#           participation is verified via kora_nodeStatus
#
# Stall detection (ready mode):
#   On each invocation, the script fetches eth_blockNumber and compares it
#   against the value from the previous check (cached in /tmp/healthcheck_*).
#   If the block number has not advanced for HEALTHCHECK_STALL_THRESHOLD
#   consecutive checks, the health check fails. This catches nodes whose
#   RPC is up but consensus has stalled.
#
#   The stall counter resets whenever the block number advances.
#   A grace period of HEALTHCHECK_GRACE_BLOCKS=0 means any single stalled
#   check increments the counter.  Default threshold is 6 consecutive stalls
#   (at 30s interval = 3 minutes of no progress before unhealthy).
#
# Consensus participation check (ready mode):
#   After the block-number stall check, queries kora_nodeStatus to verify:
#   1. The node has sufficient peers for BFT quorum (partitionStatus != "partitioned")
#   2. The node's finalized block count is advancing (not just serving stale RPC data)
#   These checks detect nodes that appear alive via RPC but are disconnected
#   from consensus — a blind spot in the original eth_blockNumber-only check.
#
#   The finalized-count stall check uses the same threshold as the block-number
#   check so that both signals trigger unhealthy at the same pace.
